## Test Project from Mac terminal

This small projects aims to:
    - test my GH connection from a Mac terminal
    - refresh my terminal terminology and usage knowledge (navigating, using vim, writing code from terminal)
    - run a quick Monte Carlo (and possibly Markov) simulation on a basic example


Monte Carlo simulation basis:
1. Given a portfolio with starting $100
2. Each day, 50-50% of 1% loss or 1% gain
3. Run simulation many times to arrive at expected value


The simulation really is just to make the git, Mac Terminal, brew, vim exercise more fun
